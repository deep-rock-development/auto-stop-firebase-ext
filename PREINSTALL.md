Use this extension to stop Firebase and Google Cloud Services when a specified budget threshold is reached in your project.

This extension supports the following use cases:

- Stop your project from accuring more costs than you intend.
- Disable predefined services when costs ramp up unexpectedly.
- Control the costs of your project and rest easy knowing you will not have any unexpected bills.
- Kill switch your non-production environment services.

The extension delivers on these use cases by:

- **Strategy 1:** Removing the billing account from your project through the Billing API, thereby stopping all services from running (Recommended)
- **Strategy 2:** Disabling predefined Google Cloud Services in your project through the Service Usage API.

### Things you will need

- Decide on a stop strategy (Strategy 1 or Strategy 2)

#### Post-installation setup

After the installation of this extension, you must:

- Create a Budget against your project (if none exists), and connect it to the Pub/Sub topic created
- Assign the extension's service account the `roles/billing.projectManager` role (for Strategy 1)
- Assign the extension's service account the `roles/serviceusage.service` role (for Strategy 2)
